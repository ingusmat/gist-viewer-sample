# Gist Viewer

### The Mission
To create a public gist viewer.

### The Details
Once finished, we should be able to search for a GitHub username and see
all the public gists for that user. From each gist, we should be able to view all the files in that gist. To make things
a little more interesting, we also want to be able to mark our favorite files inside a gist.

### Time Taken
The goal was to build this in 2 hours.  This would have given us a skeleton of an app, and I really wanted
to show what I could do, so I spent about 6 on it all together.  With more time, I could have built it out
a lot more, including tests, a working api, using real gists, etc.  I intend to do this on a rainy day, because this project
was fun.

### The API and Data
All static and hard-coded.  The idea, though, is that with a very small amount of fine tuning, the app could very easily
use a real api and real data.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`
In the interest of time, there are no tests. If we build it out more, we will include tests, but the requirements
clearly said tests are not necessary in this specific task.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It works, but there is absolutely no need to ever do this.

## Acknowledgements
The boilerplate for the app is Create React App
